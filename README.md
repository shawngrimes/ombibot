## How to use:

```
plex search ricky bobby
```

will return Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby

Command Structure:

```
[trigger] [command] [expression]
```

- `trigger` - one of "plex" or "ombibot" or "ombi"
- `command` - one of "download" or "find" or "search" or "get" or "request"
- `expression` - the movie you're searching for (TV support coming soon.)

You can also send DMs to the bot, for your more embarassing requests. The DMs don't require the trigger word.
